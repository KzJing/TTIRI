# TTIRI
This repository provides the code and data used in our manuscript ‘Deep learning reveals determinants of transcriptional infidelity at nucleotide resolution in the allopolyploid line by goldfish and common carp hybrids’.

## 1. Introduction
This repository provides the transcriptional infidelity region prediction model mentioned in our paper (in the ‘prediction’ folder in the root directory), as well as the position-specific motif quantitative interpretation method we designed (in the ‘interpretation’ folder in the root directory).

## 2. Setup environment
For the configuration of the python environment it is recommended to refer to the [DNABERT2 model](https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/DNABERT_2) author to provide the steps as our model is based on it.
